# DataStructures
A 5-stage project giving students practice in implementing data structures for the first time,
including HashTables, Stacks, Tries, Heaps, and BTrees.
It also involved writing our own unit-tests using JUnit and Maven.
The fifth stage also involved gaining familiarity with the GSON library and its methods.
